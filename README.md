    <h2>TableView For Android</h2>
    <p align="center">
        <p>TableView is a powerful Android library for displaying complex data structures and rendering tabular data composed of rows, columns and cells. 
           TableView relies on a separate model object to hold and represent the data it displays. This repository also contains a sample app that is
           designed to show you how to create your own TableView in your application.</p>
